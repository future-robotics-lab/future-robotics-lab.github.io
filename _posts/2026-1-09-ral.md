We propose a deterministic, contact-aware path planner for neurovascular navigation that leverages kinematic model to predict and exploit anatomical interactions for fast and accurate control of pre-bent passive tools.

Attached is a video demonstrating results of our planner using a guidewire-catheter system to autonomously navigate into three common aortic arch types, targeting two different branches in each scenario.
