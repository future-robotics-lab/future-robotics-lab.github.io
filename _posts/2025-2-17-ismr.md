In this work, we propose a motion planner for autonomous navigation of telescopic pre-bent catheterization tools (guidewires and catheters) in acute ischemic stroke interventions. Attached is a video showcasing our actuation system using the planner to autonomously navigate the guidewire into the target branch.
