# Atrial Fibrillation

## Coming Soon!

<!-- ## Overview
Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia treated through catheter ablation, a procedure that requires precise control of the catheter tip to create lesions on the heart wall.

## Our Approach
We propose a compact magnetic catheter ablation system using a ball-chain-based magnetic catheter and cart-mounted rotating magnets for external actuation.
