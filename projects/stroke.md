# Stroke Interventions

## Overview
- Stroke treatment requires rapid intervention to prevent severe disability or death.  
- **Mechanical thrombectomy** is the used for large vessel occlusions but is limited by access to specialists.  
- We aim to **autonomously navigate endovascular tools** using **pre-operative imaging and motion planning**.  


## Our Approach
- **Flexible tool modeling**: Predicts guidewire and catheter behavior for controlled movement.  
- **Contact-aware motion planning**: Interacts with vessel anatomy for precise tool navigation.  
- **Cost-effective actuation**: Uses standard endovascular catheterization tools without requiring specialized hardware.
